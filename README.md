2010 WPhonors - WordPress Honors Awards
========

The WPhonors site I made in 2010 was the first majorly publicized site released which made use of the then newly introduced features in WordPress 3.0. These features included custom post types, custom taxonomies, navmenus, and more.

The concept of the site was comparable to the Oscar Awards or Hip Hop Honors but for WordPress and the community that surrounds WordPress.

### The Launch

Upon launching WPhonors, there were **23 sponsors** whom contributed multiple prizes totalling something like **60+ prizes** to giveaway, making it the **largest WordPress prize giveaway ever!**.

Within a month after the site was launched, it **gained 2000+ registered users**, and a ton of user generated content from all of the submissions to each of the custom post types for the contest.

### The Post Types

Each of the 4 types of posts that users could submit content were also broken down into their own types of custom taxonomies. Overall, the site was broken up like this:

  * Sites
    * Personal
    * WordPress Related
    * Business
  * Plugins
    * Free Plugins
    * Commercial Plugins
  * Themes
    * Free Themes
    * Commercial Themes
    * Theme Framework
  * Personalities
    * Designer
    * Developer
    * Blog Author
    * WP Community

On the blog or default 'post' type of the site you could find any updates or announcements for what users needed to do to win the prizes, and also who the winners of each were as well.

### Round One of Voting

There were two rounds of the contest to determine the winners for each category of each type.

The first round was when users could submit their nominees for each of the types of posts and categories and vote on the things they wanted to win, each of the posts had a custom plugin I made which added a **Like** button. If not logged in it would say Login or Register which would open a dialog box for doing this.

There was a link on top of the site also that would allow users to login, register, or reset their password all from within the homepage of the site, within a dialog. Once they were logged in, this dialog would change to be a post submission form, one for each of the post types, separated into different tabs. Users never even needed to login to the WordPress dashboard to do anything, it was all possible from the main area of the site.

### User Dashboard

However, if they were to visit the dashboard, they would see a very highly customized and completely different looking WordPress dashboard than what is the default for all WordPress sites. I augmented the dashboard so much that it didn't look like WordPress anymore. There were custom dashboard widgets for all to view that had **Site Links** to each section of the site, and also a list of the **Last 20 Submissions**, along with a **customized Right Now WordPress widget** that was modified to include the custom post types.

### Round 2 of Voting

The second round of the contest was when the submissions were closed, and the finalists were chosen by number of votes and by a select set of judges that were part of the WordPress community.

### Judges Dashboard

The judges had a higher and **custom made user level** which they were given special permissions and therefore could see even more custom features within the dashboard. They had a custom dashboard widget that listed all the **Top Voted Posts** sorted by the most votes first. They also had a **Judging Criteria** page which listed all the judges and contact info, the general judging criteria and a judging checklist for each of the categories and post types which the judges were expected to use as a reference when making their vote. Also, judges had an additional custom post type that was used for the **Finalists** which they could make their vote for. The winners were chosen based on number of votes the finalist had from the users, and also from the judges. _The goal was to keep the contest from being a favorites game of who could get the most votes_.

Once the year ended, the judging was over and the final winning submissions were announced on a separate page which displayed the finalist custom post type showing only those posts in that post type which were selected as a winner.

### Administrator features only

As an admin, there were additional areas of the dashboard which I made for my own personal use. I wanted to be able to see the users list which was in the multiple thousands listing each users submissions to each post type as a link to their posts. This involved **augmenting the Users panel** that was not easily modifiable in WordPress.

Also, due to the large number of sponsors most of whom donated multiple prizes of their particular product or service, I had come to realize after doing the math that there were as many prizes as there were days left in the year.

I was **giving away a prize a day** for 2+ months. I needed a way to keep track of who won what prize and what type of prize it was exactly, and which sponsor the prize was from and the contact info for both in order to put them in contact with one another, and so I could track how many prizes were left from each sponsor since they donated multple prizes.

So I made a **Prize Inventory custom panel** for the dashboard which only admins had access to. This also required including a **Prize Calendar** as well so I could keep track of what I gave away and when.

It was a lot of work, but the initial site only took me two weeks to build, largely because of the 8 months previous to making it, I was making a different site similar to Forrst.com but made with **WordPress 3.0 alpha**. I had already made a very similar type of site which I just had to modify the post types to work for WPhonors. It was quite brilliant and a huge success.
