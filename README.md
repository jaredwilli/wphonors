2010 WPhonors - WordPress Honors Awards
========

The WPhonors site I made in 2010 was the first majorly publicized site released which made use of the then newly introduced features in WordPress 3.0. These features included custom post types, custom taxonomies, navmenus, and more.

The concept of the site was comparable to the Oscar Awards or Hip Hop Honors but for WordPress and the community that surrounds WordPress.

Upon launching WPhonors, there were 23 sponsors whom contributed multiple prizes totalling something like 60+ prizes to giveaway, making it the largest WordPress prize giveaway ever!. Within a month after the site was launched, it gained a couple thousand registered users, and a ton of user generated content from all of the submissions to each of the custom post types for the contest, which included WordPress related: Sites, Themes, Plugins, and Personalities.

Each of the 4 types of posts that users could submit content were also broken down into their own types of custom taxonomies. Overall, the site was broken up like this:

  * Sites
    * Personal
    * WordPress Related
    * Business
  * Plugins
    * Free Plugins
    * Commercial Plugins
  * Themes
    * Free Themes
    * Commercial Themes
    * Theme Framework
  * Personalities
    * Designer
    * Developer
    * Blog Author
    * WP Community

On the blog or default 'post' type of the site you could find any updates or announcements for what users needed to do to win the prizes, and also who the winners of each were as well.

## The contest had two rounds for determining the winners.

The first round was when users could submit their nominees for each of the types of posts and categories and vote on the things they wanted to win, each of the posts had a custom plugin I made which added a *Like* button. If not logged in it would say Login or Register which would open a dialog box for doing this.

There was a link on top of the site also that would allow users to login, register, or reset their password all from within the homepage of the site, within a dialog. Once they were logged in, this dialog would change to be a post submission form, one for each of the post types, separated into different tabs. Users never even needed to login to the WordPress dashboard to do anything, it was all possible from the main area of the site.

However, if they were to visit the dashboard, they would see a very highly customized and completely different looking WordPress dashboard than what is the default for all WordPress sites. I augmented the dashboard so much that it didn't look like WordPress anymore. There were custom dashboard widgets for all to view that had links to each section of the site, and also a list of the last 20 submissions, along with a customized Right Now WordPress widget that was modified to include the custom post types.

The second round of the contest was when the submissions were closed, and the finalists were chosen by number of votes and by a set of judges that were chosen from the WordPress community. The judges had a higher and custom made user level which they were given special permissions and therefore could see even more custom features within the dashboard. They had a custom dashboard widget that listed all the posts sorted by the number of votes that they got with the most voted at the top, and they also had a Judging Criteria page, and an additional custom post type that was used for the Finalists. The winners were chosen based on number of votes the finalist had from the users, and also from the judges.

As an admin, there were additional areas of the dashboard which I made for my own personal use
